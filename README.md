# Iris.jl

A package for computing scattering and spectral properties for Helmholtz wave operators with complex media.

This is a Finite-Difference Fourier Domain solver (FDFD).

In development.


Below is an example of a calculation made with Iris.
It is a many-in, many-out reflectionless scattering made on a chaotic waveguide junction, as appears in our [RSM paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04017)
